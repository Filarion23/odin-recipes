    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>400g (14oz) spaghetti</li>
        <li>150g (5oz) guanciale, pancetta, or streaky bacon</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>80g (¾ cup) freshly grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>(Optional) 2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>(Optional) 2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>

	<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti and cook until al dente according to the 
            package instructions. Reserve one cup of pasta water, then drain.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the pasta cooks, cut guanciale (or pancetta/bacon) into small pieces. Cook in a large skillet 
            over medium heat until golden and crispy. (Add minced garlic for extra flavor in the last minute, if 
            using.)
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, egg yolks, most of the cheese (reserve some for topping), a 
            pinch of salt, and plenty of black pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add hot, drained spaghetti directly to the pan with guanciale, tossing to coat well in the rendered fat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from heat. Immediately pour in the egg mixture and quickly toss with the pasta, adding reserved 
            pasta water a little at a time as needed to create a creamy sauce that coats the strands.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve immediately, topped with remaining cheese, black pepper, and parsley if desired.
        </li>
    </ol>
